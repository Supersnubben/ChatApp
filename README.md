Welcome to ChatApp.

This is an attempt to create my own chat app for personal use inside my family.

My 9 year old daughter has been using messenger and other social apps to keep in touch with our relatives, but keep adding strangers to her chats with all the built in functions. She has now been forbidden to use these apps, by us, because she isn't mature enough to handle the freedom these apps provide to contact strangers online.

So my plan is to create our own closed app just for family and close friends so that she can keep in touch with everyone the way she wants.
